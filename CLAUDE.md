## Project Overview

This is a new project for stock information management/analysis. The project structure and tooling will be established as development progresses.

## Project Status

**Note:** This is a newly initialized project. As the codebase develops, this file should be updated with:
- Build, test, and development commands
- Architecture decisions and patterns
- Key dependencies and their purposes
- Common development workflows
- Important conventions or constraints

## Development Setup

To be documented once project structure is established.

## Architecture

To be documented as the codebase grows.

## Notes for Future Updates

When updating this file, focus on:
- Non-obvious architectural decisions that require reading multiple files to understand
- Commands and workflows specific to this project
- Important context that helps navigate the codebase efficiently
- Avoid listing obvious file structures or generic best practices
